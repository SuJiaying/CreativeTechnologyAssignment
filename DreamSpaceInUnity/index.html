            <p>The Virtual Dream Space I envision features a heart-shaped lake surrounded by a meadow with flowering herbs. I imagine it as a scene from a childâ€™s dream, so I also want to include furniture commonly found in a children's room.</p>

            <p>I created the furniture models in Blender. Initially, when I imported them into Unity, the wood material was lost. To fix this, I unwrapped the UVs for all wooden parts, baked the materials into texture maps, and then imported both the maps and models into Unity.</p>

            <p>To capture the chaotic nature of a child's dream, I combined high-fidelity and low-poly objects in the space, creating a blend of the real world and children's toys (or picture books).</p>

            <p>Furniture in the foreground is at a normal scale relative to the first-person controller, while furniture in the distance is enlarged up to 100 times, enhancing the dreamlike sense of distortion.</p>

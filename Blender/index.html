            <p>I want to design something like a lighting tool for a future shaped by Hebraic values and Nature as Sacred. Our current lighting tools are highly function-driven, so incorporating ecocentrism or non-human-centered functions could be interesting. The idea of nature worship reminds me of Art Deco and Art Nouveau aesthetics, which might serve as inspiration for my design.</p>

            <p>The future society I envisioned is set around the mid-22nd century. By then, the Nordic region might develop a religion that worships natural elements, so I designed a shrine for honoring nature.</p>

            <p>The shrine's silhouette is inspired by the snowdrop, a common flower in Northern Europe. The irregularly shaped light at the center symbolizes the natural elements people wish to worship. You can imagine it as an abstract representation of fruits, leaf veins, mountains, rivers, and glaciersâ€”similar to how the cross or the Virgin Mary serves as symbols in Christianity.</p>

            <p>This project is a small exploration into the creative potential of Blender’s Geometry Nodes. By weaving a tightly controlled parametric system with a biologically intuitive concept, the work investigates how logic-driven design can evoke instinctive, emotional responses. Drawing inspiration from the theory of supernormal stimuli—a phenomenon where exaggerated traits trigger stronger-than-natural reactions—I created a visual expression loosely based on the paper Impacts of Soil Nutrition on Floral Traits in Cucumbers. The result is a digitally grown cucumber vine and floral structure that amplifies natural patterns into seductive, overstimulating forms.</p>
